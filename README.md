# Home Security Alarm System

## Overview
The Home Security Alarm System is designed to provide a simple and effective way to monitor the security of your home. The system includes a pinpad for entering a 4-digit security key and various motion sensors that can be placed at different locations around your home. When motion is detected, the alarm is triggered, and the system will require you to enter the correct 4-digit code to deactivate the alarm.

## Features
- Add multiple sensors to different locations in your home (e.g., front door, windows, hallway).
- Pinpad with a 4-digit security code for activating and deactivating the alarm.
- Real-time motion detection triggers the alarm, alerting you to potential intrusions.
- Requires entering the correct 4-digit code to turn off the alarm.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface.


## How to Use

### Activating the Alarm System:
1. When the system is powered on, you will be asked to set your 4-digit security key via the pinpad.
2. To activate the alarm, simply leave the system in "armed" mode. The system will now monitor for motion.

### Deactivating the Alarm:
1. If motion is detected, the alarm will sound immediately.
2. To deactivate the alarm, go to the pinpad and enter the correct 4-digit security code.
3. Once the correct code is entered, the alarm will stop, and the system will return to the armed state.

### Adding New Sensors:
